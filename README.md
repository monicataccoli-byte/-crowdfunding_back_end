# Pawpal Hero – Crowdfunding Back End  
Monica Taccoli

## Planning

### Pawpal Hero  
**Be a Pet’s Saviour**

Pawpal Hero is a Django-based crowdfunding platform designed to prevent the euthanasia of dogs and cats by funding guaranteed, ethical care through a **time-based rescue model**. Instead of abstract fundraising goals, donations are converted into **measurable foster days**, ensuring each Pawpal remains safe while awaiting adoption or lifelong sanctuary care.

This project demonstrates how thoughtful backend architecture can support transparency, dignity, and real-world social impact.
